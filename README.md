# Jeopardy
This program was created as part of a project for my Engineering 110 class at UofL.
The theme of the project was to develop a game in C that could
be presented to the class.

The game that we decided to create was Jeopardy. It randomly decides, from
a programmed list, which categories will be included in this playthrough.
The questions for the chosen categories are then loaded from the 'questions'
folder and labeled at the top of the screen. A player would choose a category
and point value by clicking the corresponding button which would then open
a screen with the question and 4 answer choices. At the bottom would be the
players' points and the program's decision of which player should be taking
their turn. After a correct answer, you go back to the main board screen and
that player chooses the next question. After an incorrect answer, the game
changes the players' turns in a left-to-right manner. The player with the
most points when all questions have been completed will be considered the
winner
